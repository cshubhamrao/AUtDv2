Welcome to the project page of Auto Upload to Drive v2! (henceforth: AUtDv2) 
It's good to see you here. Remember, if you are able to access this page, 
it means that the creator chose to share with you. (and probably you are one of 
the *few*) Please respect this fact and feel special! :smile:


Proposal
-------------
**Original Proposal:** The original proposal for this application was contained
in a private email to [REDACTED] , the contents of which cannot be shared here 
:wink:

Below is my attempt to reproduce the contents of the email:

### The Problem
We as students of Informatics Practices are (now) required to maintain 
"Screenshots" for MySQL outputs & Java programs and source code of our programs 
in Java...
This process of archiving, storing and transmitting is (currently) achieved in 
the following steps:

####Java/NetBeans:

 - Create the program in NetBeans 
 - Finish all the work. Start all over if
 - Create a .zip of theProject folder 
 - Email the .zip to yourself 
 
####MySQL 
It goes something like: 

- Type the everything in terminal
-  Take a screenshot of the terminal
   window 
- Paste the screenshot in a MS Word/Google Doc
- Spend unreasonable amounts of time fixing the layouts and size of the
   images. 
- Saving the file 
- Email it to yourself

While this method works, it has the following problems:

- Versioning i.e. keeping track of which .zip is newer or which .zip contains 
the desired project/program is difficult.
- Redundancy i.e. it is quite possible that you may have two or more copies of 
the same program.
- Keeping track of the date/CW numbers may be difficult.
- Tedious.
- Boring. 
- Believe it or not, email's not the best place to store files.
- ~~School Internet is sloooow.~~ No longer the case :sweat_smile:
