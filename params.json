Remember, if you are able to access this page, \r\nit means that the creator chose to share with you. (and probably you are one of \r\nthe *few*) Please respect this fact and feel special! :smile:\r\n\r\nProposal\r\n--------\r\nThe original proposal for this application was contained\r\nin a private email to [REDACTED], the contents of which cannot be shared here\r\n:wink:, (for obvious reasons)\r\n\r\nBelow is my attempt to reproduce the contents of the email:\r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\nStudents are required to maintain \"Screenshots\" of MySQL commands' outputs & Java programs and source code of our programs in Java...\r\nThere is no way to work at home and at school on a single project.\r\nThere is just no simple way of taking backups of MySQL Databases.\r\n\r\nThe process of archiving, storing and transmitting is (currently) achieved in \r\nthe following steps:\r\n\r\n#### Java/NetBeans:\r\n\r\n - Create the program in NetBeans \r\n - Finish all the work. Start all over if deleted\r\n - Create a .zip of the Project folder \r\n - Email the .zip to yourself \r\n OR\r\nForget backups at all!\r\n\r\n#### MySQL: \r\n\r\n - Type the everything in terminal\r\n - Take a screenshot of the terminal window \r\n - Paste the screenshot in a MS Word/Google Doc\r\n - Spend unreasonable amounts of time fixing the layouts and size of the\r\n   images. \r\n - Saving the file \r\n - Email it to yourself\r\n\r\nWhile this method works, it has the following problems:\r\n\r\n - Versioning i.e. keeping track of which .zip is newer or which .zip contains \r\n the desired project/program is difficult.\r\n - Redundancy i.e. it is quite possible that you may have two or more copies of \r\n the same program.\r\n - Keeping track of the date/CW numbers may be difficult.\r\n - Tedious.\r\n - Boring. \r\n - Believe it or not, email's not the best place to store files.\r\n - ~~School Internet is sloooow.~~ No longer the case :sweat_smile:\r\n",
